# Notes

The various ways I could create my personal site:

1. Vanilla everything
2. CSS Options:
    a. Vanilla CSS
    b. (Pre/Post)processors like Sass and Less
    c. A CSS framework like Bootstrap
3. JS Options:
    a. A framework like React, Angular, Veux, etc.
    b. A framework with a component library like Semantic UI for React
        i. A framework & component library with in-line CSS
        ii. A framework & component library with CSS modules
        iii. A framework & component library with CSS in JS
        iv. A framework, component library, and CSS in JS framework like Styled Components 

Some flexion points:

- How to incorporate styling
- Whether to use a JS library/framework
- Whether to use a component library for a JS framework
- How to incorporate styling within in the context of a JS library/framework, e.g. whether to use Styled Components for React.
