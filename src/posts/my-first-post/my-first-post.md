# My First Post

This is my first post. It has some content. 

It has a list!

- List item one
- List item two
- List item three

It also has a block quote:

    "This is a blockquote. I have no idea whether this will work!"

    -Julian

I'll be very interested to see whether that works!

The image is acting very strangely. It seems to fade out immediately. It's also ignoring my config about not linking to the original image.
